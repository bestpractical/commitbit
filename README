       CommitBit - An opensource project administration tool

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       CommitBit is a tool for managing commit access to opensource projects.
       It also provides for a "code.yourorganization.org" site with links to
       your wiki, mailing lists, bug tracking and so on.

       The project is in the early stages of development and could desperately
       use some help. If you're interested, please write to jesse@bestpracti-
       cal.com and ask for a commit bit.
