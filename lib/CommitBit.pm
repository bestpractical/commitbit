CommitBit - A project administration tool

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CommitBit is a tool for managing commit access to software projects.
It also provides for a "code.yourorganization.org" site with links
to your wiki, mailing lists, bug tracking and so on.

The project is in the early stages of development and could desperately
use some help. If you're interested, please write to
jesse@bestpractical.com and ask for a commit bit.
